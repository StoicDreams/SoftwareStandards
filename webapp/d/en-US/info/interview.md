# Better interviewing for better Software Engineers

```sideimage "left" "https://cdn.myfi.ws/v/Vecteezy/employment-recruitment-concept-showing-human-resource.svg"
When interviewing candidates for a software engineering position, our ultimate goal should be to find candidates that are capable of building the software that we want to be built.

Now, for most software products, the majority of candidates, if not all, will likely meet this criterion. It's just a question of how long it takes them to deliver a product that is bug-free and maintainable.

Based on our experience, most candidates, if allowed to dictate their standards and workflows, could likely develop a higher quality product in a shorter amount of time, working by themselves, versus the development team, they're being interviewed to join.

This is because most companies utilize strict and unproductive standards and workflows, harmful micromanagement practices, as well as overflowing projects with too many developers, which slows down development as well as degrades the quality of the product being produced.

In all honestly, we believe most companies would probably achieve better results if they just accepted the first applicant applying to an open role, limited their projects to only 1 or 2 software engineers, but allowed them to develop the software however they saw fit to do it. The only thing a decent software developer needs is a good project manager to help communicate business requirements, and exceptional software developers don't even need that much most of the time.

## The problems with today's Big-Tech Software Engineer hiring processes

Engineering software can often be time-consuming and costly, especially when companies don't do it correctly. An agile engineering process should iterate and test ideas frequently, with feedback loops between engineers, those who have a vested interest in the project's success, and customers happening throughout the entire development cycle.

There is no foolproof way to measure technical skill in a software engineer, so rather than attempting to find if someone is good at their job, hiring managers are instead looking for employees that share their thought process. To do this, they have created interview loops that lack diversity and neglect those who think differently.

Even if they claim otherwise, large tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta do not want the best software engineers. They favor those that think like them; people that solve problems their way. Consequently, these big businesses become saturated with yes-men who have difficulty innovating as their interviewing processes eliminate applicants with different thinking styles who could bring original ideas to them.

In many cases, businesses are not searching for Software Engineers who would engineer software solutions to problems. They commonly desire programmers who will write the code for solutions that executives have already defined.

If you take a close look at the way technical screening is done today, you'll notice that it's geared toward programmers instead of software engineers.

The primary component for most technical screenings is the whiteboard /coding test.

The interviewer will give you a specific problem to solve during the interview, and most of the time, they already have a set solution in mind. To test if you know the material, they will sometimes present you with part of the solution--like a function with given input and output. Your job at this point is to finish solving the pre-defined solution so that it matches as closely as possible to what the interviewer has in mind.

These tests do nothing to find great software engineers, despite what the proponents of these systems believe or will tell you.

In other words, the only thing these types of tests do is ensure that an interviewee thinks the same way as the interviewer in terms of programming ability-- and even then, that's only in the context of the interviewee being a programmer, not a software engineer.

More often than not, in a job interview process, those who schmooze the interviewer and sell their way into the position are more likely to get hired over those with great problem-solving skills.

I have seen far too many software engineers gain and hold their title because they are confident and great at spouting technical speak to management that doesn't know enough to understand what they're saying is BS, but when it comes to programming or engineering software they are completely lost and don't know what they are doing. This always leads to more "junior" developers having to fix and finish the work from these "senior" developers.

## If you want the best Software Engineers, you need to think differently

```sideimage "right" "https://cdn.myfi.ws/v/Vecteezy/upskilling-learn-as-work-educational-qualification-rise-flat.svg"
Skilled software engineers not only understand how to engineer software, but also the importance of being efficient to provide quality work. They are aware of their strengths and weaknesses and use this knowledge to streamline their workflow.

So how do we screen for this?

It is simple, you can't. Just like it's impossible for a developer to give an accurate "estimate" that will deliver a quality feature within the timeframe a manager is happy with, we can't measure the quality of someone's ability to develop software in an environment that provides dramatically different variables than what the developer is accustomed to working in.

With only a resume and portfolio to go off of, it can be difficult to ascertain if someone would make a good software engineer. By doing your due diligence and asking the right questions, you may get a better idea of their skillset. However, keep in mind that some people are simply great at selling themselves and may not be as skilled as they let on. From our experience, the better someone is at selling themselves that they're a great software engineer, the worse they are at engineering software.

The only way to gauge how good of a software engineer someone is, is by giving them a project to work on.

In our opinion, the best way to test a software engineer's skills is to assign them a project.

This doesn't need to mean hiring them full-time. You could hire them for a contract position and have them work with a project manager.

Let them choose their workflows, coding standards, etc. And if you're company is supportive of multiple tech stacks, then let them choose what tech stack they want to use for the project.

Allow them the liberty to engineer a solution that they think is best. Only then can you truly discern their abilities.

Then at the end of the contract work, have a team code review session where the developer can discuss what they did and why, and the team can ask questions and provide their thoughts. And if you are satisfied with their work, then give them an offer for full-time employment, an extended contract, or whatever you're offering to your software engineers.

And if you don't like their work, then obviously there is no commitment to continue working with them.

Not only does this allow you to truly see their best work, but it also opens the door to more constructive communication on how they develop and their thought process, as well as allowing your current team to learn from someone who might have a different perspective from them.
