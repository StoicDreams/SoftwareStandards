# Simple Software Engineering

```quote "info" "Erik Gassler
The foundation for everything we do, should be to keep things as simple as possible.

After all, the primary purpose of a computer should be to make difficult work easier, time-consuming work faster, and even make impossible tasks possible.

## What is Simple?

The term "simple" can be relative. For example, you may want to take a complicated feature or problem and break it down into smaller pieces. Or, when creating a method, you want to make sure that the process only has one purpose. By breaking things down or keeping them focused, they become less overwhelming and more manageable--even if they're modified versions of what initially seemed impossible.

If you come across a method that accomplishes multiple tasks, consider breaking each task out into child methods.

Creating a class (or file) should be kept as simple as possible, with limited purposes or behaviors. If you find your class getting complex, consider breaking it down into a base class, and moving certain related fields and methods to a new class.

Before you start a new project, it can be helpful to think about all of the different pieces that will make up the end result. Once you have identified those pieces, try to break them down into even smaller sub-pieces.

Creating a simple, manageable process is an important part of continuous agile software engineering. By taking a complicated task and breaking it down into smaller pieces, you can make sure that each component is simple and focused. This makes the overall process more manageable and less overwhelming. Additionally, by starting with small pieces, you can build and test each component individually using test-driven development workflows. In this way, you can ensure that your final product is high quality and meets the needs of your users.
