## Introduction

<webui-paper>

Continuous Agility focuses on the idea of maintaining flexibility and adaptability in the face of changing requirements, technologies, and customer needs.

By following the principles of Continuous Agility, software developers and teams can better respond to changes, prioritize customer value, and minimize waste.

## Core Principle 1: Never Follow with Absolution

<webui-paper>

Never Follow with Absolution emphasizes the importance of avoiding dogmatic adherence to any single method, framework, or process. Instead, teams should embrace adaptability by being open to trying novel approaches, adapting existing processes, and learning from experiences to continuously improve and optimize the way the team works.

Encourage critical thinking and empower team members to question the status quo, challenge assumptions, and propose alternative solutions, fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Tailor processes to the team's needs by recognizing that every developer and team is unique and adapt processes and methodologies to suit the specific needs, strengths, and challenges of the team and its developers.

## Core Principle 2: Be Customer Focused

<webui-paper>

Being Customer Focused emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the needs and wants of the customer, which can include stakeholders as well as actual customers, throughout the development process. By keeping the customer at the heart of decision-making, developers and teams can ensure that they are delivering valuable, high-quality solutions.

To achieve customer focus, developers and teams should continuously gather and evaluate feedback, implementing processes and tools to gather customer feedback at every stage of the development lifecycle, from initial planning to post-release.

When deciding which features to develop or tasks to prioritize, always consider and prioritize the impact on customer value and satisfaction, while also considering impact on short-term and long-term productivity.

Foster collaboration with customers by involving customers in the development process. Create channels for communication and collaboration, ensuring that customer insights and perspectives are considered.

## Core Principle 3: No Estimates or Time-Boxing

<webui-paper>

No Estimates or Time-Boxing challenges traditional planning and scheduling methods by emphasizing flexibility and adaptability over rigid and wasteful timelines and deadlines. By eliminating time-boxing and delivery estimates, teams can focus instead on value delivery.

Shift the focus from meeting deadlines to delivering customer value, allowing the team to prioritize work that provides the most value in the shortest amount of time.

Without rigid deadlines and estimates, developers and teams can contribute substantially more time to design, architecture, and coding, as well as be better equipped to respond to change more effectively, having the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements, new technologies, or unforeseen challenges without being constrained by time.

This greatly reduces waste by developers and teams not spending time and effort on creating and maintaining estimates and time-boxes. Teams can allocate their resources more efficiently towards delivering customer value in a manner thatâ€™s better for productivity and momentum. No cutting corners to get work done by the end of the sprint, no waiting for the next sprint to start the next task.

## Conclusion

<webui-paper>

By adopting the principles of Continuous Agility, software development teams can better navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology and customer needs. Embracing adaptability, focusing on customer value, and moving away from rigid timelines and estimates allows teams to deliver high-quality solutions more efficiently and effectively. In doing so, they create an environment that promotes continuous improvement, innovation, and success.
