## Core Principle 1: Minimize Complexity

```paper
Reducing complexity in code, processes, and tools is essential for improving the overall quality and maintainability of software projects. By minimizing complexity, development teams can enhance their ability to understand, modify, and adapt the codebase to meet new requirements and customer demands.

When developing a new feature or fixing a bug, take the time to review the existing code and identify areas that can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Simplify algorithms, extract reusable methods, and replace complex, nested control structures with more straightforward alternatives.

Consider incorporating well-established design patterns into your software architecture, evaluating and weighing any advantages or disadvantages to doing so. Common design patterns can sometimes help reduce complexity while providing reusable and proven solutions to common problems.

But at the same time do not be afraid to come up with your own design pattern if you find that has a better alignment of benefits versus cons within your team and the problems you are trying to solve.

## Core Principle 2: Eliminate Waste

```paper
Eliminating waste in the development process involves removing unnecessary tasks, unused code, excessive or deprecated documentation, and other activities that do not contribute to delivering value.

One strategy you can use for eliminating waste is to prioritize tasks using the MoSCoW method, which is a technique for prioritizing tasks based on their importance. By categorizing tasks as Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves, teams can focus on delivering the most important features first, while postponing or eliminating less important tasks. You could also extend this method to cover how you organize features, grouping or tagging them into Must-Haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Wonâ€™t-haves.

Another great strategy for eliminating waste is to limit your work in progress to a single task or goal. By limiting the number of tasks that a developer or team is working on simultaneously, developers can focus on completing tasks faster and more efficiently, rather than being overwhelmed by too many tasks and constant context-switching.

## Core Principle 3: Prioritize Value

```paper
Focusing on delivering the most value to customers should be the main priority of any development team.

For example, you might start a new project by implementing a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. An MVP is a product with the minimum set of features necessary to provide value to customers and collect feedback for future development. By focusing on delivering an MVP first, development teams can avoid wasting time on features that may not be important to customers.

Another example would be to use customer feedback to prioritize features. Actively seek feedback from customers to identify which features are most important to them. Prioritize these features in the development process to help ensure that the product meets customer needs and expectations.

## Conclusion

```paper
Keeping things simple is the foundation of a successful software development project. While most of the tenets of CASE have an arbitrary ordering, Keep it Simple is the first tenet by design, because it is perhaps the most important and has probably had the biggest impact in my success as a Software Engineer.

Remember though that simplicity, like all other tenets and principles should be, is a goal, not an absolute. And I generally prioritize simplifying user experiences over simplifying code or architecture.
