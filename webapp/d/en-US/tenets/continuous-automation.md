## Introduction

<webui-paper>

Continuous Automation emphasizes the importance of automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks throughout the software development process. By continuously automating tasks such as testing, building, and deployment, teams can save time, increase efficiency, and improve the overall quality of their products.

## Core Principle 1: Automate Everything

<webui-paper>

Identify and automate every task that can be automated, such as testing, building, and deployment. By automating these tasks, teams can reduce the time and effort required to perform them, which in turn increases productivity, improves quality, and reduces the time to market.

To apply this principle, software engineers and teams should focus on identifying tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, or prone to errors, and find ways to automate them. Here are some examples of how to apply this principle in software development:

### Test Automation

Instead of manually testing code changes, teams can utilize concepts such as unit tests and integrate running them into the build pipelines, as well as tools such as Selenium to automate end-to-end testing. Automation testing enables teams to quickly run tests on different platforms, operating systems, and devices, ensuring that the code works as intended.

### Build Automation

Automate the process of building and compiling code changes. This may entail building a tool from scratch or integrating a 3rd party solution that suits the needs of your application. Ensure you consider all build scenarios, encompassing any needed environments from local development builds to potential production targets. Build automation helps to reduce the time and effort required to compile code, ensuring that builds are consistent and error-free.

By automating everything possible, teams can reduce the risk of human error, save time, and improve the quality of their products. The benefits of this approach are numerous, including higher productivity, improved quality, and reduced time to market.

## Core Principle 2: Integrate Automation into the Development Process

<webui-paper>

Integrate automation into your development processes, generally using scripts and tools, that will run automatically as part of your builds and deployments. By integrating automation, teams can reduce manual effort, increase efficiency, and ensure that automation is a part of their development process from the beginning.

To apply this principle, software engineers and teams should focus on integrating automation tools and processes as part of their local builds and deployments, as well as build and deployments that are run in response to pushing their code to the central repository. Here are some examples of how to apply this principle in software development:

### GitHub Actions

Teams using GitHub can implement GitHub Actions to automatically run desired scripts every time new code is committed to the repository. This ensures that code changes are tested thoroughly and consistently and helps to catch and resolve issues as early as possible.

### Automated Testing

Implement automated testing throughout the development and deployment workflows. Starting with automated testing that runs locally on developer machines as they’re developing so they get instant feedback on the changes they’re making, and up to automated tests that run as part of build and release pipelines.

By integrating automation into the development process, teams can reduce the risk of defects and errors, increase efficiency, and improve the overall quality of their products. The benefits of this approach include faster release cycles, improved team productivity, and reduced time to market.

## Core Principle 3: Continuously Improve Automation

<webui-paper>

Continuously improve automation processes to ensure that they are reliable, efficient, and effective. As technology evolves, so too do the tools and processes that teams use for automation. Continuously improving automation helps teams to continuously improve the quality and efficiency of their development process.

Let’s look at some examples of how software engineers can apply this principle in software development:

### Refactoring Automation Scripts

As automation scripts become more complex, they can become difficult to maintain and update. To prevent this, teams should regularly review and refactor their automation scripts to ensure that they are easy to understand, maintain, and update as needed.

### Adopting New Tools

As new tools and technologies emerge, teams should evaluate them to determine if they can improve their automation processes. For example, a team may adopt a new code analysis tool to help identify potential issues earlier in the development process. Just assure when evaluating tools that it both meets your needs and is something that improves productivity. Don’t just use a tool because it’s something that’s popular, and don’t be afraid to write your own tools that can more specifically meet your needs.

By continuously improving their automation processes, teams can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their development process. This can lead to faster release cycles, higher quality software, and improved team productivity.

## Conclusion

<webui-paper>

In conclusion, the three principles of continuous automation - automating everything possible, integrating automation into the development process, and continuously improving automation - are critical to improving the quality and efficiency of the software development process.

By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, teams can increase productivity, improve quality, and reduce the time to market. By integrating automation into the development process, teams can reduce manual effort and increase efficiency. And by continuously improving automation processes, teams can stay up to date with the latest tools and technologies, and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of their development process.

Continuous automation is essential to achieving the larger goal of Continuous Agile Software Engineering, which aims to deliver value quickly and reliably to customers.
