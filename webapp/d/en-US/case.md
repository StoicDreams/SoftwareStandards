A common axiom I hear frequently in this industry is "there's no reason to re-invent the wheel". Stop and think about that logic for a second. The first wheel is believed to have been invented around 3500 B.C. Imagine what the world would be like today if every person since then just thought "there's no reason to re-invent the wheel". The wheel has continuously been re-invented and iterated on after its initial invention, and our lifestyles are a much better place for it.

When you face a feature that needs to be implemented, sometimes it is simpler and easier to use an existing solution that already does exactly what you need. Most of the time though I find it much more beneficial, especially in the long term, to either build a new solution from scratch or iterate on an existing open-source solution. Do your research, analyze the problem, and ask questions to figure out which is better for the problem at hand.

## What is Continous Agile Software Engineering?

```sideimage "right" "https://cdn.myfi.ws/v/Vecteezy/young-programmers-code-the-web-site-on-the-laptop-from-the.svg"
Greetings, my name is Erik Gassler. I am a software developer with a passion for making workflows more efficient and productive. Throughout my career, I've been lucky enough to work with teams and companies that have given me the freedom to further develop and improve my agile software development practices.

The standards I've developed and refined throughout my career have repeatedly shown that a single developer using these standards and practices can be 5 to 100 times more productive than teams of 5-10 developers using today's popular Agile methodologies like Scrum and Sprint.

I never realized how bad the software industry was at developing software until a few years ago when I transitioned to working at Microsoft.

More often than not, I come across businesses and developers who blindly copy what they perceive to be Industry Standards. However, because nobody truly grasps the frameworks and standards in question--nor understands why they work or how they benefit--Everyone is doing something different that is failing to be productive. People are simply going with their gut feeling instead of solid evidence.

That is why I chose to create this website, which would showcase the standards that I have found to work best in developing high-quality software.

I want to help others improve their software development standards and practices so they can be more efficient and productive while also employing best practices for security, accessibility, and user experiences.

```quote "warning" "Erik Gassler"
There is an underlying philosophy behind most, if not all my standards and best practices. That is to "keep things simple".

This site will introduce you to the methodologies, principles, and practices I have developed over my career.

I have fifteen years of experience developing software with various companies, and all the views on this website come from my observations. I'm always looking for ways to be more productive and efficient, so I carefully study workflows and processes. When I see something that isn't working well, I try to find a way to improve it. This might involve taking suggestions from other developers or managers, researching methods used by others both in books and online, or developing my own methods.

I am a strong advocate for agile development and continuous delivery of features and updates. However, I have found that certain tenets and tools associated with these terms are often used incorrectly, preventing companies from achieving true agility.

For example, I do not believe that Scrum should be used in a company, organization, or team scope. Many people think of scrum as agile development when it is simply a tool. While I agree with the idea that it can be beneficial for some people in certain scenarios, it does not mean that it is right for everybody or every project. Every company that I have seen claiming to practice Scrum does not practice it in an agile way. Instead, they have structured themselves into imitating waterfall development through miniaturized cycles - mini-waterfalls. They also hold daily status meetings which they refer to as Scrum meetings, missing the fact that Scrum meetings are not intended to be status meetings.

Software development is a continuous learning experience. We should always strive to learn and improve our craft by adapting to new challenges as they come up. And understand that no tool, framework, methodology, or standard is going to be the best practice for every scenario or problem we face.

I am constantly trying to improve the quality of this documentation by adding new information and revising old standbys, but I will only be able to do so much. I hope that you understand that Continuous Agile Software Engineering should always be treated as a a work in progress and use your best judgment to fill in any gaps or make improvements to suite your needs.

## There is no one-size fits all

```sideimage "right" "https://cdn.myfi.ws/v/Vecteezy/collaboration-or-cooperate-for-team-success-working.svg"
A concept we see people chasing all the time is the concept that we need all developers in a company or team to have the same standards and workflows.

This concept is disrupting the simple fact that people are all unique and different. We all think differently, we approach problems differently, and we solve problems in different ways.

No solution or standard is best for everyone. Like time, concepts like readability and organization are relative concepts. What one person finds to be easily readable and well-organized, another may find illegible and cluttered.

As an industry, we need to stop chasing this pipe dream and acknowledge and embrace the fact that we are all different.

Be able to adapt your teams and projects to embrace your developers' strengths and give support for their weaknesses.

Some developers can only be productive when they are given clear, explicit instructions on what to do and how to do it. There is nothing wrong with this. Give them what they need, and they will produce great work.

Other developers may be less productive when given clear, explicit instructions on what to do and how to do it. There is also nothing wrong with this. Give them more abstract problems to solve and don't micromanage their decisions. You'll get better results from them while also freeing up time that would be spent providing them with instructions.

Some developers will perform better using a tool like Scrum to organize and manage their work, while others will find it disruptive and hindering their work.

You may have developers that thrive working in constant collaboration with their team. Talking through problems and solutions to figure out directions to take. Group these types of people.

Other developers may thrive working by themselves, only wanting to collaborate to figure out specific challenges they need help with or helping others when they need specific help. Allow these people to work independently and have the option of excluding themselves from team collaboration meetings.

And additionally, don't demand the same standards, workflows, and methodologies for all of your developers, teams, or projects. Instead, allow freedom for people to use what works best for them, while also having the freedom to share and learn from other developers. This way they can continue learning and growing and adopt newer, better practices at their own pace, while never being forced into a practice or standard that decreases their productivity or the quality of their work, which would in turn reduce their motivation and morale with the team or company.

## Twelve Tenets of Continuous Agile Software Engineering

```section
The CASE methodologies are broken up into twelve tenets, with each tenet containing three core principles.
```

`````section

````cards
```card "Tenet 1: Keep it Simple" "580" "success"
Keeping things simple means that software development should focus on delivering value in the simplest viable way. This is achieved by minimizing complexity in code, processes, and tools.

Keeping things simple needs to be both a mentality and a habit, and is aimed at helping to reduce the cost of development, improve quality of both the code and software, and reduce the time to market. It also helps to keep the development process agile, as simpler code and processes are easier to change and adapt to new requirements.

#### 1: Minimize Complexity

Avoid unnecessary complexity in code, processes, and tools. This helps to reduce the cost of development, improve quality throughout, and reduce the time to market.

#### 2: Eliminate Waste

Eliminate waste in the development process by removing unnecessary tasks, documentation, and other activities that do not add value. Eliminate code that is not being used and code comments that not adding value.

#### 3: Prioritize Value

Prioritize value over other factors such as features, aesthetics, and performance. This helps to ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering the most key features first. But also understand value doesnâ€™t have to be monetarily based or exclusive to customers / users. Some value may be for developers, stakeholders, or others as well.
```

```card "Tenet 2: Code Ownership" "580" "success"
Code Ownership is the concept that each repository within a team should have a designated owner responsible for its maintenance and improvement over time. The following are three core principles that can guide the implementation of Code Ownership:

#### Assign Ownership of Code

Each code repository should have a designated owner responsible for its overall quality, maintenance, and improvement over time. This owner should be the primary point of contact for all matters related to the code within that repository and have the authority to make decisions about its evolution, including code formatting and organization.

#### Foster Collaboration Among Owners

Ownership does not mean isolation. Code owners should collaborate with each other to share ideas and concepts and learn from each otherâ€™s different perspectives and opinions. They should communicate frequently and openly to avoid redundancy, minimize conflicts, and make sure everyone is aligned with the business and team goals.

#### Rotate Ownership Over Time

Code ownership is not a lifelong appointment. As projects evolve, so do the skills, interests, and availability of team members. To ensure that code remains fresh and up-to-date, and owners do not grow stagnant, ownership should rotate periodically. This approach fosters a sense of shared responsibility and prevents bottlenecks that can occur when a single person is responsible for too much code.
```

```card "Tenet 3: Continuous Agility" "580" "success"
Continuous Agility means that teams should continuously adapt to changing requirements and market needs and be able to pivot quickly when necessary.

Continuous agility helps to ensure that teams can respond to new challenges and opportunities, and that they are always focused on delivering value to their customers.

#### Never follow with Absolution

When working within principles, guidelines, best- practices, never constrain yourself to following them with absolute adherence. There is no one- size-fits-all solution that is the best solution for every situation.

#### Be Customer-Focused

Maintain a customer-focused mindset and continuously seek feedback to ensure that products are meeting their needs and expectations and adapt tasks based on the feedback loops.

#### No Estimates or Time-Boxing

Break down projects and features into manageable tasks, but no task, feature, or project should be given deadlines or require developer estimates prior to or during active development.
```

```card "Tenet 4: Continuous Feedback Loops" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous feedback loops throughout the software development process means that developers and teams should continuously gather feedback from their IDEs, compilers, analytics, stakeholders, customers, and team members, and use that feedback to refine the development process and features being delivered.

Continuous feedback loops help teams and developers to stay focused on delivering value to customers, and to identify and address issues as early as possible in the development process. This helps to reduce the cost of development, improve quality, and increase customer satisfaction.

#### Gather Feedback

Continuously gather feedback from their tools, analytics, stakeholders, customers, and team members throughout the development process.

#### Use Feedback to Inform Decisions

Use feedback to inform decisions about features, design, and other aspects of the development process.

#### Iterate Based on Feedback
Continuously iterate on the development process based on feedback to improve the product and development process.
```

```card "Tenet 5: Continuous Automation" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous automation throughout the software development process means that teams should continuously automate repetitive and time- consuming tasks, such as testing, building, and deployment.

Continuous automation helps to reduce the time and effort required for these tasks, which in turn helps to increase productivity, improve quality, and reduce the time to market.

#### Automate Everything Possible

Identify and automate every task that can be automated, such as testing, building, and deployment.

#### Integrate Automation into the Development Process

Integrate automation tools and processes into the development process to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency. Always make this a top priority to do this as early as possible.

#### Continuously Improve Automation

Continuously improve automation processes to ensure that they are reliable, efficient, and effective.
```

```card "Tenet 6: Continuous Planning" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous planning throughout the software development process means that teams should continuously plan and adjust the development process based on feedback and changing requirements. This also means that teams should spend minimal time planning development or features that are not being immediately worked on.

Continuous planning helps teams to stay aligned with customer needs and market trends, and to make timely adjustments to the development process as needed. This helps to reduce the risk of developing products that do not meet customer needs or fail in the market.

#### Emphasize Continuous Planning

Prioritize planning throughout the development process, from initial requirements gathering to release planning.

#### Use Data-Driven Approaches

Use data-driven approaches, such as user feedback, A-B testing, and market trends, to inform planning decisions and adjust the development process.

#### Continuously Refine Plans

Continuously refine plans based on feedback, discoveries made during development, and changing requirements, and communicate updated plans to all stakeholders as they occur.
```

```card "Tenet 7: Continuous Collaboration" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous collaboration throughout the software development process means that teams should continuously collaborate with all stakeholders, including customers, product owners, developers, and testers.

Continuous collaboration helps to ensure that everyone is aligned with the project goals and objectives, and that everyone has a shared understanding of the product requirements and features.

#### Foster a Collaborative Culture

Establish a collaborative culture that encourages open communication, sharing of ideas, and respect for all team members.

#### Collaborate Throughout the Development Process

Collaborate with all stakeholders throughout the
development process, from requirements gathering to release planning.

#### Use Collaborative Tools and Processes

Use collaborative tools and processes, such as Notion and Teams, to facilitate collaboration among team members.

Take special note that this does not require every person to handle all communication themselves. Instead, it is generally ideal to utilize a hierarchy of contacts that will pass on communications to those that need it, minimizing any developer downtime while still allowing information to be properly communicated.

For example, a software engineer is making a change to the plan, so they communicate that change to the project manager. The project manager in turn will communicate that change to other engineers that are directly affected as well as key stakeholders. Those key stakeholders may then communicate that change to other stakeholders, and so on.
```

```card "Tenet 8: Continuous Learning" "580" "success"
Continuous learning means that developers and teams should be continuously learning to help improve their skills, processes, workflows, and products.

Continuous learning helps to ensure that teams stay up to date with the latest technologies, methodologies, and practices, and that they continuously improve the quality of their products and the efficiency of their development process.

#### Emphasize Continuous Learning

Prioritize learning throughout the development process, from initial requirements gathering to post-release evaluations.

#### Encourage Experimentation

Encourage team members to experiment with new ideas, technologies, methodologies, and practices to continuously improve the development process and products.

#### Foster a Culture of Learning

Foster a culture of learning that encourages sharing of knowledge and experiences, both positive and negative, among team members and provides opportunities for learning and growth.
```

```card "Tenet 9: Continuous Testing" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous testing throughout the software development process means that teams should continuously test their products throughout the development process, from requirements gathering to release, utilizing automated testing as much as possible.

Continuous testing helps to ensure that teams catch and fix defects as early as possible in the development process, which then helps to reduce time resolving those defects.

#### Establish a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach

Apply a TDD approach, where testing is integrated into the development process, and tests are written before the code is developed.

#### Automate Testing

Automate testing as much as possible, to increase efficiency and consistency. If a tool isnâ€™t available to apply the type of testing you need, then take the time to build the tool so you can apply your tests.

#### Test Continuously

Test continuously throughout the development process, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
```

```card "Tenet 10: Continuous Iterations" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous iterations throughout the software development process means that teams should continuously iterate on their products and processes to improve their quality and efficiency.

Continuous iterations help to ensure that teams are always improving their products and processes, and that they are continuously adapting to changing requirements and market needs.

#### Emphasize Continuous Improvement

Prioritize continuous improvement throughout the development process, from initial requirements gathering to post-release evaluations.

#### Conduct Regular Retrospectives

Conduct regular retrospectives to review the development process and identify areas for improvement.

#### Adapt Quickly

Adapt quickly to changing requirements and market needs by iterating on products and processes.
```

```card "Tenet 11: Continuous Integrations" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous integrations throughout the software development process means that teams should continuously integrate their code changes into a single source of truth, such as a shared repository while only using a single main branch and test their changes as frequently as possible.

Continuous integrations help to ensure that teams are always working with the latest version of the codebase and that any issues are identified and resolved as quickly as possible.

#### Single Branch Version Control

Use a version control system to manage code changes and ensure that all team members are working with the latest version of the codebase. Ensure all development is done directly in a single main branch.

#### Automate Integration Testing

Automate integration testing to ensure that code changes are tested thoroughly and that any issues are identified and resolved as quickly as possible.

#### Integrate Frequently

Integrate code changes into the shared repository as frequently as possible, to ensure that team members are always working with the latest version of the codebase.
```

```card "Tenet 12: Continuous Delivery" "580" "success"
Establishing continuous delivery throughout the software development process means that teams should aim to deploy their code changes to production as frequently as possible through completely automated processes.

Continuous delivery helps to ensure that teams can deliver new features and improvements to their users quickly and efficiently. It also helps to reduce the risk associated with deploying code changes to production by automating the deployment process and ensuring that code changes have been thoroughly tested before deployment.

#### Automate Production Deployment

Automate the deployment process from the moment code is pushed up from the developerâ€™s machine all the way through production, only stopping from deploying if an automated test fails.

#### Automate Development Deployments

Keep tooling, documentation, and scripts available and easily accessible so any developer working on a project can quickly and easily setup local development environments with a focus on making the process as self-service as possible.

#### Monitor and Measure

Monitor and measure the performance of the software after every deployment to assure quality standards are met and performance never degrades unexpectedly. Again, this should be largely automated, but still apply manual checks as needed.
