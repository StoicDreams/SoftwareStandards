## Purposeful Pre-Planning

In an agile workflow, it is generally not important, necessary, nor even desirable to figure out any technical details at the start of the project. Instead, you should be figuring out those details along the development journey as the need arises.

There are however more abstract details that are greatly beneficial to know and understand both at the start of any project and during its development.

The content below presents a template with a series of questions that you should ask, get answered, and document at the start of the project if possible, or at least as early in development as you can.

Understand as well that as an agile developer, you expect data and requirements to change. And as answers to these questions are better defined or changed entirely, keep your documentation up to date to assure everyone is on the same page.
